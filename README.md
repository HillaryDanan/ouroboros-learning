# Ouroboros Learning Framework

## Self-Consuming Cycles in AI Cognition

By Hillary Danan | August 2025

### Learning Framework

This framework reveals how AI models learn through self-consuming cycles where controlled forgetting enables breakthrough insights. Built on my TIDE-Analysis infrastructure, it measures and visualizes the ouroboros patterns in different AI architectures.

### Core Concept

```
K(t+1) = Ω[K(t)] = G(T(C(K(t))))
```

Knowledge evolves through cycles of:
1. **Integration** - Accumulating understanding
2. **Consumption** - Breaking down existing patterns  
3. **Transformation** - Recombining in novel ways
4. **Generation** - Emerging with higher-order properties

### Expected Findings/To Be Tested

Based on prior resultss (630 AI responses, p < 0.0001):
- **Gemini** (71.5% coherence) → Tight, regular cycles
- **Claude** (55.1% coherence) → Flexible, adaptive cycles
- **GPT-3.5** (38.3% coherence) → Chaotic or minimal cycles

### Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/hillarydanan/ouroboros-learning.git
cd ouroboros-learning

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the analysis
python run_ouroboros_analysis.py
```

```

### Motivation

This framework aims to test whether:
- Different cognitive architectures are features, not bugs
- Controlled forgetting enables insights  
- AI models exhibit neurodiversity-like patterns
- Failure can create revolution/ingenuity
